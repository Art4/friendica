Instructions For Connecting To People On Specific Services
==========================================================

Friendica
---

You can either connect to others by providing your Identity Address on the 'Connect' page of any Friendica member.
Or you can put their Identity Address into the Connect box on your [Contacts](contacts) page. 


Diaspora
---

Add the Diaspora 'handle' to the 'Connect/Follow' text box on your [Contacts](contacts) page. 

Blogger, Wordpress, RSS feeds, arbitrary web pages
---

Put the URL into the Connect box on your [Contacts](contacts) page.
PLease note that you will not be able to reply to these contacts. 

This feed reader feature will allow you to _connect_ with millions of pages on the internet.
All that the pages need to have is a discoverable feed using either the RSS or Atom syndication format, and which provides an author name and a site image in a form which we can extract. 

Twitter
---

To follow a Twitter member, the Twitter-Connector (Addon) needs to be configured on your node.
If this is the case put the URL of the Twitter member's main page into the Connect box on your [Contacts](contacts) page.
To reply, you must have the Twitter connector installed, and reply using your own status editor.
Begin the message with @twitterperson replacing with the Twitter username.

Email
---

If the php module for IMAP support is available on your server, Friendica can connect to email contacts as well.
Configure the email connector from your [Settings](settings) page.
Once this has been done, you may enter an email address to connect with using the Connect box on your [Contacts](contacts) page.
They must be the sender of a message which is currently in your INBOX for the connection to succeed.
You may include email contacts in private conversations.
